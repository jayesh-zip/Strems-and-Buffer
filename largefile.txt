To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

To push your "Strems-and-Buffer" folder from VS Code to GitHub using the command line, follow these step-by-step instructions:

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

✅ 1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or from menu: Terminal → New Terminal).

✅ 2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init
✅ 3. Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ 4. Rename the Default Branch to main
git branch -M main
✅ 5. Add Remote Origin
Make sure your remote link is correct (replace with your GitHub URL if different):

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want to connect GitHub using SSH instead of HTTPS.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

git remote add origin https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
✅ 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
📝 If asked to log in: GitHub may prompt for your username and personal access token (not password). You can generate a token from GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens (select repo access).

🟢 Done!
Your folder should now be uploaded to your GitHub repo at:
🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.

The error you're getting:

remote: Permission to jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git denied to vekariyaharsh.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
means that Git is trying to push using a different GitHub account (vekariyaharsh) which doesn’t have permission to push to your jayesh-zip repository.

✅ To fix it, you have two options:
🔧 Option 1: Use the Correct GitHub Account with HTTPS (Recommended for Simplicity)
Clear old GitHub credentials:

In Windows, open Credential Manager:

Press Win + S, type Credential Manager, open it.

Go to Windows Credentials.

Find entries related to github.com and remove them.

Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
Git will now ask for GitHub credentials:

Enter your GitHub username

For password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT) (not your GitHub password)

🔐 You can generate a PAT here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Select scopes like repo, workflow.

🔧 Option 2: Use SSH Authentication (More Secure & Permanent)
Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter at each prompt.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys

Click "New SSH Key", paste the copied key.

Step 3: Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer.git
Step 4: Push again
git push -u origin main
✅ After Fixing
Once done, your push should go through and your files will appear on:

🔗 https://github.com/jayesh-zip/Strems-and-Buffer

Let me know if you want help with generating the PAT or using SSH setup.
